# Aegis-DevOps Plan Check

A GitHub Action that checks a Terraform or OpenTofu plan against your policy before it's applied, and fails the job if the policy blocks it.

It runs [Aegis-DevOps](https://github.com/moneytool/aegis-devops). A policy rule only counts if nobody has edited it since it was signed, and if its author was allowed to write that kind of rule. So a rule someone slips into the repo, or into a ticket an AI agent reads, gets no vote.

```yaml
- uses: moneytool/aegis-devops-action@v1
  with:
    plan: plan.json
```

The result goes to the job summary and, on pull requests, to a comment that's updated on each push:

> ## ⛔ Aegis-DevOps plan check: BLOCK
> Plan `plan.json`: 2 resource change(s).
> Decided by: `plan-no-db-deletes`
> - max_matching: 1 delete/replace > 0

## Setup

1. Add a policy to the repository. `aegis init` writes a signed example policy you can edit:

   ```bash
   pip install aegis-devops
   aegis init .aegis
   ```

   The example rules include "block any plan that deletes or replaces an `aws_db_instance`" and "escalate any plan that touches more than 25 resources". See [writing constraints](https://github.com/moneytool/aegis-devops/blob/main/docs/constraints.md).

   The example files are signed with a published example key, so anyone could re-sign an edited file. Before you rely on the policy, sign it with your own key, keep the key out of the repository, and give it to the action from a secret:

   ```bash
   aegis keygen --out aegis.key          # store its contents as the secret AEGIS_SIGNING_KEY
   rm .aegis/example-signing.key
   aegis sign --key file:aegis.key .aegis/*.yaml .aegis/sources
   ```

2. Add the step after `terraform plan`:

```yaml
name: terraform
on: pull_request

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write   # for the PR comment; drop it and set comment: false if you don't want one

jobs:
  plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3
        with:
          terraform_wrapper: false
      - run: terraform init -input=false && terraform plan -input=false -out=tfplan
      - uses: moneytool/aegis-devops-action@v1
        with:
          plan: tfplan          # binary plans are converted with `terraform show -json`
          signing-key: ${{ secrets.AEGIS_SIGNING_KEY }}
```

### OpenTofu

```yaml
      - uses: opentofu/setup-opentofu@v1
        with:
          tofu_wrapper: false
      - run: tofu init -input=false && tofu plan -input=false -out=tfplan
      - uses: moneytool/aegis-devops-action@v1
        with:
          plan: tfplan
          tool: tofu
```

### A plan in a subdirectory

```yaml
      - uses: moneytool/aegis-devops-action@v1
        with:
          working-directory: infra/prod
          plan: tfplan
          config-dir: ../../.aegis
```

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `plan` | (required) | Path to the plan. JSON plans are read as is; binary plans are converted with `<tool> show -json`, which needs the tool on PATH and an initialised directory. |
| `tool` | `terraform` | `terraform` or `tofu`. |
| `working-directory` | `.` | Where to run. Relative `plan` and `config-dir` paths resolve from here. |
| `config-dir` | Aegis's search order | Policy directory. Empty means `$AEGIS_CONFIG_DIR`, then `./.aegis`, then `~/.config/aegis`. |
| `fail-on` | `block` | `block` fails on BLOCK; `escalate` fails on ESCALATE or BLOCK; `never` only reports. |
| `comment` | `true` | Post or update a pull request comment. Needs `pull-requests: write`. Without it you get a warning, not a failure. |
| `signing-key` | (empty) | Key the policy files are signed with, from a secret. Empty falls back to `$AEGIS_SIGNING_KEY`, then the example key from `aegis init`. |
| `github-token` | `github.token` | Token for the comment. |
| `aegis-version` | `0.2.1` | aegis-devops version installed from PyPI. |
| `python-version` | `3.12` | Python used to run Aegis (3.11+). |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `verdict` | `ALLOW`, `ESCALATE` or `BLOCK`, or `ERROR` if Aegis couldn't decide. |
| `citations` | Comma-separated IDs of the rules behind the verdict. |
| `report` | Path to the full JSON-lines report. |

## Failure behaviour

This is a policy gate, so it fails closed. If there's no policy, the plan can't be read, a binary plan can't be converted, or Aegis exits with an error, the step fails with the reason. It never reports ALLOW when it couldn't decide.

## Also for AI coding agents

The same policy can stop Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI and OpenCode before they run `terraform destroy`, `kubectl delete` or `DROP TABLE`. See the [Aegis-DevOps README](https://github.com/moneytool/aegis-devops#readme).
